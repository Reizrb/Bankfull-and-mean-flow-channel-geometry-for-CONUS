# __Mean-flow Condition__
To independently assess the mean-flow width and depth, we generate a new dataset (Check Table 1 for more detail and Figure 1 for spatial distribution map) by averaging reach-averaged width and depth using the US Army Corps of Engineers eHydro survey database, accessible at [here](https://www.sam.usace.army.mil/Missions/Spatial-Data-Branch/eHydro/) and [here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/4b8f2ba307684cf597617bf1b6d2f85d). 

* __The generated dataset, _IE_Meanflow_, is publicly available in [Google Drive]().__

# __Bankfull Condition__
The bankfull independent evaluation dataset (Check Table 2) is gathered from [Mulvihill et al., (2009)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20095144),  [Keaton et al., (2005)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20055076), [Dutnell, (2000)](https://www.riverman-engineering.com/thesis-text.pdf), [Moody et al., (2003)](https://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov/references/public/AZ/Arid_SW_Report_Regional_Curves.pdf), [McCandless & Everett, (2002)](https://www.roads.maryland.gov/OPR_Research/MD-02-SP707B4D-Maryland-Stream-Survey.pdf), [Brockman, (2010)](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1055&context=gradschool_theses),  [Lotspeich, (2009)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20095206), [Parola et al., (2007)](https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Water/Reports/Reports/NPS0010-Bluegrass.pdf), [Metcalf, (2004)](https://trid.trb.org/View/748355), [Chase, (2004)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20041260), and [Mccandless, (2003)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/TamaraMccandless/publication/237472244_Maryland_Stream_Survey_Bankfull_Discharge_and_Channel_Characteristics_in_the_Allegheny_Plateau_and_the_Valley_and_Ridge_Hydrologic_Region/links/56ce-12b708ae059e375355bf/Maryland-Stream-Survey-Bankfull-Discharge-and-Channel-Characteristics-in-the-Allegheny-Plateau-and-the-Valley-and-Ridge-Hydrologic-Region.pdf).
