* Two types of models are developed and validated for each dependent variable (bankfull width, bankfull depth, mean-flow width, and mean-flow depth):\
__Model 1)__ using HYDRoSWOT-derived discharge, denoted as Q<sub>bnk</sub> for bankfull condition and Q<sub>mf</sub> for mean-flow condition. \
__Model 2)__ using HDPlusV2.1-derived mean annual flow, enoted as Q<sub>E</sub> . 

* Ttraditional statistical methods, namely _Multi-Linear Regression (MLR)_, and advanced tree-based Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, namely _Random Forest Regression (RFR)_ and _eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR)_, are utilized for model developement.
